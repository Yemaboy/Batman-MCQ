# Batman-MCQ
This is a high school project from March 2022.
In this project, my computer science teacher asked to create a qcm on any universe or theme ( One piece , cats , cars ...).
We had to create only a few questions using HTML for the questions, CSS for the aesthetics and Javascript for the creation of a function counting the number of correct answers to the questionnaire.
This is the first project where I used Javascript.
